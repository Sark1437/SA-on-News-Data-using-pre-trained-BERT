# SA-on-News-Data-using-pre-trained-BERT
This is a pre-trained BERT tuned on Malo et al (2014) dataset for investor sentiment classification purposes and another script used for deployment. Both used in support of my master's thesis. Note that other variants of sentiment classifiers were trained, however, only this one, being the most successful was uploaded.
