# SA-on-News-Data-using-pre-trained-BERT
This is a pre-trained BERT tuned on Malo et al (2014) dataset for investor sentiment classification purposes, along with its trained model for evaluation. Both used in support of my master's thesis. Note that other variants of sentiment classifiers were trained, however, only this one, being the most successful is uploaded.
